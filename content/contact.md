Eastinco Consulting is partners Qiang Yu and Yue Zheng. We will be happy to answer any of your questions. We welcome suggestions, are grateful to those who point out errors, and are always looking for information and articles of interest to our readers. If something you've read elsewhere on this site makes you want to reach us, great! Here's how to do it:

Call Skype: Between 9am and 5pm UK Greenwich time, Monday to Saturday, please. Skype ID: qiang.yu_1

At any point in time, we typically have several projects "on the go" but are prepared to discuss taking on another. Depending on your needs, you have several "first steps" available in engaging Eastinco Consulting to solve some of your problems.

* If you'd like some software built for you, or you would like to engage one of us as a mentor, for yourself or your team, just drop us an email. We can improve your programming skills, your development process, even your presentation, speaking, and writing skills.
* If you would like training or presentation materials prepared, whitepapers written, or sample/reference software written, contact Qiang by email to set up a phone meeting and explore some possibilities. We take this work on for selected technologies where we have the background required to do the job well.
We understand that in many cases you will want an NDA signed before you can discuss with us the project you are planning to undertake. That's no problem at all.
